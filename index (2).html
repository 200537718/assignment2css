        Verse 1:
        Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people
Livin' for today
Ah
    
      
        
        Chorus:
       Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people
Livin' life in peace
You
        
        
        Verse 2:
   You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
        
        Chorus:
        
        I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You
        Verse 3:
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one
